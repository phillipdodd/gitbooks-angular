# Tools

## [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html)

**Karma** is the **test-runner** and what actually executes our tests in the browser.

Used by the **Angular CLI.**

## [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

**Jasmine** is used to create **mocks** and ensure the tests are behaving the way they **should** according to our **expectations**.

Used by the **Angular CLI.**

## [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

Not _just_ for React!

## [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) / [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

## [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)

For when Jasmine's mocking abilities aren't enough.

## [Test Double](https://testdouble.com/)

Like Sinon but less popular.

## [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com/)

Paid application that lets you see tests in your browser.

## [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
