# Mocking

## Types of Mocks

### Dummies

Little more than a placeholder when you don't need a particular object but still need an instance of one.

### Stubs

A **Stub** has **controllable behavior;** one is able to set what a stub's functions will return.

### Spy

Keeps track of which of its methods were called, how many times they were called, and with which parameters they were called.
